This project is an excercise in data management without any back end work. It enables the user to pick his teams for the 2018 season and watch his point totals against other users.

This project uses 2 API calls - one from FantasyData(for odds and team records) and one from SportRadar (for game schedule) to gather data. The data is stored in Google Firestore and uses it's Google Firebase authentication structure to register users.

The entire project is displayed in one page. The user, after sign-in, is offered to make his picks for evrey week on the left panel. On the right, he/she is presented with his/her weekly point total and a list of overall leaders. For a correct pick two points are awarded, for a tie one point, and no points for an incorrect pick. Picks cannot be made after a week has started.

This project was a group project for a coding bootcamp and includes contributions from 4 students. Enjoy!
